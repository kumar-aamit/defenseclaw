# DefenseClaw Observability

DefenseClaw v4 separates **audit sinks** (durable event forwarders) from
**OpenTelemetry** (standard metrics/traces/logs). Both are first-class,
both are vendor-neutral, and both are configured declaratively in
`~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml`.

> **Breaking in v4 (beta):** the old `splunk:` block was replaced by
> `audit_sinks:`. Config load will refuse to start if the legacy block
> is present. Migrate as described below.

---

## 1. Concepts

### 1.1 Audit sinks

Every `Event` the audit logger writes (scan verdicts, guardrail
verdicts, block/allow decisions, webhook fires, lifecycle events) is
persisted to the local SQLite audit store **and** fanned out to every
enabled sink.

Sink kinds:

| Kind          | Use case                                                       |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `splunk_hec`  | Splunk HTTP Event Collector (SIEM).                            |
| `otlp_logs`   | Any OTLP-compatible log backend (Splunk O11y, Grafana, Honey). |
| `http_jsonl`  | Generic HTTP endpoint that accepts newline-delimited JSON.     |

Sinks are independent: you can run zero, one, or many in parallel.
A failing sink does **not** block a decision — audit remains local-first.

### 1.2 OpenTelemetry

`internal/telemetry` is a plain OTLP client — gRPC or HTTP, logs +
metrics + traces, configurable via `otel:` in the config file or the
standard `OTEL_*` environment variables. There is **no** Splunk-specific
coupling in the telemetry stack; operators who need a Splunk access
token put it in `otel.headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`.

---

## 2. Migration from v3 → v4

If you previously had:

```yaml
splunk:
  enabled: true
  hec_endpoint: https://splunk.example.com:8088
  hec_token_env: SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN
  index: defenseclaw
```

rewrite as:

```yaml
audit_sinks:
  - name: splunk-prod
    kind: splunk_hec
    enabled: true
    splunk_hec:
      endpoint: https://splunk.example.com:8088
      token_env: SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN
      index: defenseclaw
      source: defenseclaw
      sourcetype: defenseclaw:audit
```

DefenseClaw will **fail fast** on startup if any legacy `splunk.*` key
is still set — this is intentional so you cannot silently lose
forwarding after an upgrade.

### 2.1 Automated migration

Instead of rewriting the YAML by hand, run:

```bash
defenseclaw setup observability migrate-splunk --apply
```

The command is idempotent — re-running it on a config that has already
been migrated is a no-op. Omit `--apply` for a dry-run preview.

---

## 3. Sink reference

### 3.1 Common fields

```yaml
audit_sinks:
  - name: my-sink          # required, unique
    kind: splunk_hec       # required
    enabled: true          # default: false

    # Optional batching / timeout knobs (all sinks):
    batch_size:       200
    flush_interval_s: 5
    timeout_s:        10

    # Optional per-sink filters:
    min_severity: MEDIUM         # INFO | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
    actions:      [guardrail-verdict, tool-block]   # only emit matching actions
```

### 3.2 `splunk_hec`

```yaml
- name: splunk-prod
  kind: splunk_hec
  enabled: true
  splunk_hec:
    endpoint:   https://splunk.example.com:8088
    token_env:  SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN     # preferred
    # token:    ${SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN}  # inline (flagged as warning)
    index:      defenseclaw
    source:     defenseclaw
    sourcetype: defenseclaw:audit
    verify_tls: true
    ca_cert:    /etc/ssl/certs/splunk-ca.pem
```

### 3.3 `otlp_logs`

```yaml
- name: grafana-logs
  kind: otlp_logs
  enabled: true
  otlp_logs:
    endpoint:    https://otlp.grafana.net
    protocol:    http           # or grpc (default)
    url_path:    /v1/logs        # http only
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${GRAFANA_OTLP_TOKEN}"
    insecure:    false
    ca_cert:     ""
```

### 3.4 `http_jsonl` (Generic HTTP JSONL audit sink)

> **Not a notifier webhook.** This sink forwards *every* audit event to
> a single URL as newline-delimited JSON. Chat/incident notifications
> (Slack, PagerDuty, Webex, HMAC-signed) are a separate system —
> `webhooks[]` — configured with `defenseclaw setup webhook`. See §7
> below.

```yaml
- name: events-jsonl
  kind: http_jsonl
  enabled: true
  http_jsonl:
    url:          https://events.example.com/ingest
    bearer_env:   EVENTS_BEARER_TOKEN   # preferred
    # bearer_token: ${EVENTS_BEARER_TOKEN}
    verify_tls:   true
    ca_cert:      ""
```

Each line posted to the endpoint is a JSON object with the full audit
event shape (`id`, `timestamp`, `action`, `target`, `severity`,
`details`, `run_id`, …).

---

## 4. OpenTelemetry

Minimal config:

```yaml
otel:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://otlp.example.com:4318
  protocol: http          # or grpc
  headers:
    X-SF-Token: ${SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN}
    # any other vendor-specific auth header

  traces:  { enabled: true }
  metrics: { enabled: true, temporality: delta }
  logs:    { enabled: true }

  tls:
    insecure: false
    ca_cert:  ""
```

You can also drive the telemetry stack entirely through standard
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` env vars — the SDK's defaults apply when the
config is empty.

---

## 5. Event shape (what every sink receives)

```json
{
  "id":        "c5b8a6fe-1e23-4a17-8f0d-6a7a6de8f45d",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-14T17:05:11.123Z",
  "run_id":    "2026-04-14T17-02-00Z",
  "actor":     "defenseclaw",
  "action":    "guardrail-verdict",
  "target":    "amazon-bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet",
  "severity":  "HIGH",
  "details":   "action=block; reason=injection.system_prompt; source=regex_judge"
}
```

Sinks that support a native event envelope (Splunk HEC, OTLP Logs) map
these fields onto the native shape; `http_jsonl` posts the raw JSON.

### PII redaction in the event pipeline

Every audit event is run through `internal/redaction` before it reaches
the SQLite store or any remote sink. The pipeline preserves safe
metadata (rule IDs like `SEC-ANTHROPIC`, severity, target names,
finding titles) while masking literal values:

- Anthropic / OpenAI / Stripe / GitHub / AWS secrets
- Credit cards, SSNs, phone numbers, email addresses
- Matched message bodies and tool arguments

Redaction is **unconditional** for persistent sinks. `DEFENSECLAW_REVEAL_PII=1`
only affects operator-facing stderr logs (for local incident triage); it
has no effect on SQLite, webhooks, Splunk HEC, or OTLP logs — those
always receive the scrubbed copy.

> **Never set `DEFENSECLAW_REVEAL_PII=1` in production.** This flag is
> intended for developer workstations and short-lived incident-triage
> sessions only. When set, the gateway will print matched literals
> (secrets, credentials, PII) to stderr — any shared terminal,
> `tmux`/`screen` buffer, recorded session, support bundle, or shell
> history that captures that output becomes a new exfiltration channel.
> Restrict its use to isolated reproduction environments with
> throwaway data, and unset it before attaching the process to any
> shared transport (journald, syslog, container log drivers, CI logs).

Masked placeholders are deterministic (they include a SHA-256 prefix of
the literal), so SIEM/observability workflows can still correlate on
identifier hash across events without handling the raw secret.

To opt back into raw evidence for a single `/inspect` HTTP response, use
the `X-DefenseClaw-Reveal-PII: 1` header documented in `docs/API.md`.
That path audit-logs the reveal and still writes the redacted copy to
the store.

---

## 6. Health

`defenseclaw-gateway status` reports a `Sinks` subsystem that aggregates
every configured audit sink:

```
Sinks:   running — 2 sinks (splunk_hec, otlp_logs)
```

Per-sink health and failure counters are exposed on the gateway
`/health` endpoint under `sinks.details.sinks[]`.

---

## 7. Notifier webhooks (`webhooks[]`)

Notifier webhooks are **not** audit sinks. They deliver low-volume,
human-facing notifications — Slack messages, PagerDuty incidents,
Webex rooms, or generic HMAC-signed JSON — filtered by severity and
event category.

| Surface                        | Schema key                  | What it does                                    | Example preset          |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `setup observability add`      | `audit_sinks[]`             | High-volume, every-event forwarding             | `webhook` → `http_jsonl`|
| `setup webhook add`            | `webhooks[]`                | Per-event chat / incident notifications         | `slack`, `pagerduty`    |

### 7.1 CLI

```bash
defenseclaw setup webhook add slack \
    --url https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX \
    --events scan.failed,block \
    --min-severity high

defenseclaw setup webhook add pagerduty \
    --routing-key-env PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY \
    --min-severity critical

defenseclaw setup webhook add webex \
    --room-id Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00v… \
    --secret-env WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN

defenseclaw setup webhook add generic \
    --url https://ops.example.com/alerts \
    --secret-env OPS_WEBHOOK_HMAC_KEY \
    --min-severity high

defenseclaw setup webhook list
defenseclaw setup webhook show <name>
defenseclaw setup webhook enable  <name>
defenseclaw setup webhook disable <name>
defenseclaw setup webhook remove  <name>
defenseclaw setup webhook test    <name>   # dispatches a synthetic event
```

All secrets are resolved from env vars (never written in `config.yaml`).
URLs are validated against SSRF (private ranges, localhost, cloud
metadata endpoints are rejected by default).

### 7.2 YAML schema

```yaml
webhooks:
  - type:             slack            # slack | pagerduty | webex | generic
    url:              https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX
    secret_env:       ""               # unused for slack (URL carries the secret)
    room_id:          ""               # webex only
    min_severity:     high             # info | low | medium | high | critical
    events: [scan.failed, block]
    timeout_seconds:  10
    cooldown_seconds: 60               # optional; omit (null) to disable debounce
    enabled:          true
```

`cooldown_seconds` is a tri-state: *omitted / null* → use the
dispatcher default (`webhookDefaultCooldown`, currently 300s);
`0` → dispatch every matching event; `>0` → explicit minimum seconds
between dispatches per (webhook, event-category) pair.

### 7.3 TUI

The Setup wizard exposes a **Webhooks** step that runs through the
same `setup webhook add` path non-interactively. The Config Editor
surfaces a read-only `Webhooks` section (CRUD lives in the wizard or
CLI because list-of-structs + per-entry secrets aren't safely editable
via single-key form fields).

### 7.4 Doctor

`defenseclaw doctor` runs a `Webhooks` probe per entry:

- SSRF guard (same rules as the gateway dispatcher)
- `secret_env` / room_id presence for types that need it
- reachability (HEAD/OPTIONS) — **never** dispatches live events; use
  `setup webhook test` for an end-to-end synthetic dispatch.
